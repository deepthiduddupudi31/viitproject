        Engineering is one of today’s fastest-growing and most exciting fields, offering new college graduates excellent income potential, career stability, and significant personal satisfaction. Engineers can choose from a diverse range of careers. However, not everyone can become an engineer due to the high skill and knowledge requirements. Each engineering discipline demands its own set of technical skills, and even within the same profession, specific job roles vary significantly in their requirements.

        A major concern today is that formal education often fails to equip individuals with the skills necessary for employment. Skilled workers are in high demand. Globally, the proportion of formally skilled workers shows India lagging at 2%, compared to Korea (96%), Japan (80%), Germany (75%), the United Kingdom (68%), and China (40%). India has immense potential to enhance skill-based learning to meet local labor demands and serve as an effective global manpower hub.
