      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-linkedin mb-6 text-center">Student Activity Council</h1>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology (VIIT) believes that education extends beyond academics, theoretical studies, lectures, and seminars. It encompasses vital social consciousness and life skills such as leadership, group dynamics, and emotional balance. These skills are essential for transforming students into successful engineers who contribute meaningfully to society. To foster these qualities and sharpen minds, VIIT students have established their own student body: “The Student Activity Council (SAC) by the students, for the students, and of the students.”
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        As the backbone of all student activities, the Student Activity Council is a dynamic and thriving body that continues to grow as an efficient, reliable, and effective student organization. Guided by its motto, “There are no secrets to success. It’s preparation, hard work, and learning from failure,” the SAC drives student engagement and development.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-linkedin mb-4 mt-10">Planning and Execution of Institution Clubs</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Joining various clubs is the best way to experience a wide spectrum of activities. These clubs provide opportunities to connect with enthusiasts and experts, creating an ideal learning environment. They serve as a vast repository of collective knowledge, passed down from one batch to another.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The Student Activity Council oversees five major clubs: Cultural, Literary, Sports, Movie, and Green Club. The SAC plans an activity calendar for all training activities organized under these clubs and ensures their execution as scheduled.
